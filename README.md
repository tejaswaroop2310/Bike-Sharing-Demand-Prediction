# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
This project presents a supervised predictive model for bike sharing demand prediction using Regression. In recent days, Pubic rental bike sharing is becoming popular because of is increased comfortableness and environmental sustainability. Data used include weather data associated with it for each hour. We used different types of Regressive models for training the data. Multiple evaluation indices such as R2, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and Coefficient of Variation were used to measure the prediction performance of the regression models. An analysis with variable importance was carried to analyses the most significant variables for all the models developed. The variable importance results have shown that Temperature and Hour of the day are the most influential variables in the hourly rental bike demand prediction.

Data Pre-processing:
In order to prepare the data for the experiment, the data is cleaned to remove outliers. It involves removing the null values, replacing missing values with dummy values, and changing the format of the date and time values so as to utilize them in the algorithm. It also includes removal of outliers.
 Data Visualization:
 Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Model Selection and Evaluation:
Here we used linear regression, SVM, Decision Tree algorithm for this data set. Decision Tree   is very efficient compared to the other models  

Conclusion:

•	we see a high demand from April for bike

•	summer is the season in which we have the more demand

•	the number of rented bikes is huge, when there is solar radiation, the counter of rents is around 1000

•	there are much more bike sharing during the day than the night

•	Accuracy is good for Decision tree followed by the linear Regression and SVR
